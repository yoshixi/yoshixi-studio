I realized that one of the basic ways to make a day more fulfilling is to get one thing done.

Lately, I've been bored and unfulfilled on my days off. I couldn't come up with any ideas to make my day more fulfilling. It's a little odd things, some work day was more fulfilling than a holiday and I noticed that a work day i could have get something done on made me fulfilled. So to make days more fulfilling, we should get something done a day.

To get one thing done within a day, we need to define what is goal. If we start doing something without a goal in mind, you may end up in a maze and never reach your goal! So I would start the day with having a goal clear.
